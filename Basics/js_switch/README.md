## JavaScript Switch Statement

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

The JavaScript Switch Statement
Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

Syntax
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
This is how it works:

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

## Example
```
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 0:
    day = "Sunday";
    break;
  case 1:
    day = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
     day = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    day = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    day = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    day = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    day = "Saturday";
}

```

## The default Keyword
The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match:

Example
The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.

If today is neither Saturday (6) nor Sunday (0), write a default message:

switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 6:
    text = "Today is Saturday";
    break;
  case 0:
    text = "Today is Sunday";
    break;
  default:
    text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
}

## Common Code Blocks
Sometimes you will want different switch cases to use the same code.

In this example case 4 and 5 share the same code block, and 0 and 6 share another code block:

Example
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 4:
  case 5:
    text = "Soon it is Weekend";
    break;
  case 0:
  case 6:
    text = "It is Weekend";
    break;
  default:
    text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
}
