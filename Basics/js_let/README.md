## JavaScript Let

The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared

Variables defined with let must be Declared before use

Variables defined with let have Block Scope


## Cannot be Redeclared
Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.

You can not accidentally redeclare a variable declared with let.

With let you can not do this:

let x = "John Doe";

let x = 0;
With var you can:

var x = "John Doe";

var x = 0;

## Block Scope
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

Example
{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here

## Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.

Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.

Example
{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here


## Redeclaring Variables
Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.

Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block:

Example
var x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{
var x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 2


Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.

Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block:

Example
let x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{
let x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 10
